# Morse-code-Encryption-and-Decryption-with-LED

In this project we will be using Arduino UNO boards, one for transmitter and another for receiver.

Here we will be transmitting the MORSE CODE through a LED and receiving the blinks of LED through the LDR sensor.

The LED will blink in accordance with the morse code dots and dashes (i.e dots will be of 10 ms and dashes will be 3X of dots, that's 30ms)

there are two part of codes, one for Transmitter and another for Receiver part.
